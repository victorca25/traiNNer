SSIM and MS-SSIM 
Can be used as loss function or as metric to compare images. Note that there
are many modifications to the original SSIM and MS-SSIM formulation in all
implementations, such as Matlab removing the image borders (shave), the 
use of a ReLU activation in TensorFlow to remove negative values in MS-SSIM
to prevent NaN cases and the kernel recomputation in MS-SSIM if the window
size is larger than the image. All of these options are available. 

Example:
    #from .ssim import ssim, ms_ssim, SSIM, MS_SSIM

    from pytorch_msssim import ssim, ms_ssim, SSIM, MS_SSIM
    # X: (B,3,H,W) a batch of RGB images with values ranging from 0 to 255.
    # Y: (B,3,H,W)  
    ssim_val = ssim( X, Y, data_range=255, size_average=False) 
    ms_ssim_val = ms_ssim( X, Y, data_range=255, size_average=False )
    # these will return a tensor in the form (B,), with the calculation for each
    # image in the batch

    # or set 'size_average=True' to get a scalar value as loss.
    ssim_loss = ssim( X, Y, data_range=255, size_average=True) 
    ms_ssim_loss = ms_ssim( X, Y, data_range=255, size_average=True )

    # or reuse windows with SSIM & MS_SSIM. 
    ssim_module = SSIM(window_size=11, window_sigma=1.5, data_range=255, size_average=True, channel=3)
    ms_ssim_module = MS_SSIM(window_size=11, window_sigma=1.5, data_range=255, size_average=True, channel=3)

    ssim_loss = ssim_module(X, Y)
    ms_ssim_loss = ms_ssim_module(X, Y)

    r""" Calculate ssim index for X and Y
    Notes:
    1) SSIM estimates covariances with weighted sums.  The default parameters
    use a biased estimate of the covariance:
    Suppose `reducer` is a weighted sum, then the mean estimators are
      \mu_x = \sum_i w_i x_i,
      \mu_y = \sum_i w_i y_i,
    where w_i's are the weighted-sum weights, and covariance estimator is
      cov_{xy} = \sum_i w_i (x_i - \mu_x) (y_i - \mu_y)
    with assumption \sum_i w_i = 1. This covariance estimator is biased, since
      E[cov_{xy}] = (1 - \sum_i w_i ^ 2) Cov(X, Y).
    For SSIM measure with unbiased covariance estimators, pass as `compensation`
    argument (1 - \sum_i w_i ^ 2).
    The correct compensation factor is `1.0 - reduce_sum(square(kernel))`,
    but to match MATLAB implementation of MS-SSIM, we use 1.0 instead.

    2) A reducer is a function that computes 'local' averages from set of images. 
     For non-convolutional versions, this is usually mean(x, [1, 2]), and
     for convolutional versions, this is usually avg_pool2d or conv2d with 
     weighted-sum kernel.

    Args:
        X (torch.Tensor): images
        Y (torch.Tensor): images
        win (torch.Tensor): 1-D gauss kernel
        data_range (float or int, optional): the dynamic range value of input images 
         (i.e., the difference between the maximum possible allowed value and the 
         minimum allowed value, usually 1.0 or 255)
        K (list or tuple, optional): scalar constants (K1, K2). Try a larger K2 
         constant (e.g. 0.4) if you get a negative or NaN results (SSIM has less 
         sensitivity to K2 for lower values, so it would be better if we taken the 
         values in range of 0< K2 <0.4) 
        compensation: Compensation factor. See above.
        size_average (bool, optional): if size_average=True, ssim of all images 
         will be averaged as a scalar
        use_padding: padding image before conv
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: ssim results (of type float32, instead of float64 like np 
         version). A pair containing the luminance measure, and the 
         contrast-structure measure.

    """Computes the MS-SSIM between X and Y.
    This function assumes that `X` and `Y` are image batches BCHW
    Note: The true SSIM is only defined on grayscale.  This function does not
    perform any colorspace transform.  (If input is already YUV, then it will
    compute YUV SSIM average.)
    Original paper: Wang, Zhou, Eero P. Simoncelli, and Alan C. Bovik. "Multiscale
    structural similarity for image quality assessment." Signals, Systems and
    Computers, 2004.
    Arguments:
      X: First image batch.
      Y: Second image batch. Must have the same rank as img1.
      data_range: The dynamic range of the images (i.e., the difference between the
        maximum the and minimum allowed values).
      weights: Iterable of power factor weights for each of the scales. The number 
        of scales used is the length of the list. Index 0 is the unscaled
        resolution's weight and each increasing scale corresponds to the image
        being downsampled by 2.  Defaults to (0.0448, 0.2856, 0.3001, 0.2363,
        0.1333), which are the values obtained in the original paper.
      window_size: Default value 11 (size of gaussian filter).
      window_sigma: Default value 1.5 (width of gaussian filter).
      K (list or tuple, optional): scalar constants (K1, K2). Try a larger K2 
       constant (e.g. 0.4) if you get a negative or NaN results (SSIM has less 
       sensitivity to K2 for lower values, so it would be better if we taken the
       values in range of 0< K2 <0.4).
    Returns:
      A tensor containing an MS-SSIM value for each image in batch if size_average 
      is set to False, otherwise, a single mean scalar value for the batch. 
      The values are in range [0, 1].
