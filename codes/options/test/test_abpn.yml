# Reading and Operating this file
# ~ is basically Null/None/False e.t.c, you can either use ~ as the value, or comment out the line
# A commented-out line's value is typically it's default but is disabled due to it being commented out
# When a line starts with two #'s (comment line starting with #), then when un-commenting, it's intended to be disabled
# for example, under network_G everything but ESRGAN's values are commented-out, so to show which should still be
# enabled/disabled, a double-comment is used
