# BasicSR [[ESRGAN]](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN) [[SFTGAN]](https://github.com/xinntao/SFTGAN) [[PPON]](https://github.com/Zheng222/PPON)

:black_square_button: TODO

- [ ] Test TV loss/regularization (needs to balance loss weight with other losses). 
- [ ] Test HFEN loss (needs to balance loss weight with other losses). 
- [ ] Test [Partial Convolution based Padding](https://github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv) (PartialConv2D).
- [ ] Test PartialConv2D with random masks.
- [ ] Add automatic model scale change (preserve conv layers, estimate upscale layers).
- [ ] Add automatic loading of old models and new ESRGAN models.
- [ ] Downscale images before and/or after inference. Helps in cleaning up some noise or bring images back to the original scale.
- [ ] Adopt SRPGAN's extraction of features from the discriminator to test if it reduces compute usage
- [ ] Import GMFN's recurrent network and add the feature loss to their MSE model, should have better MSE results with SRGAN's features/textures (Needs testing)
- [ ] Test PPON training code. Inference is the same as the PPON repo.
- [x] Add on the fly augmentations (gaussian noise, blur, JPEG compression).
- [x] Add TV loss/regularization options. Useful for denoising tasks, reduces Total Variation.
- [x] Add HFEN loss. Useful to keep high frequency information. Used Gaussian filter to reduce the effect of noise.
- [x] Add [Partial Convolution based Padding](https://github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv) (PartialConv2D). It should help prevent edge padding issues. Zero padding is the default and typically has best performance, PartialConv2D has better performance and converges faster for segmentation and classification (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11718.pdf). Code has been added, but the switch makes pretained models using Conv2D incompatible. Training new models for testing. (May be able to test inpainting and denoising)
- [x] Added SSIM and MS-SSIM loss functions. Originally needed to replicate the PPON training code, it can also be used on ESRGAN models
- [x] Import PPON's inference network to train using BasicSR's framework. They use dilated convolutions to increase receptive field and compare against ESRGAN with perceptually good results
- [x] Almost complete implementation of the PPON training, based on the original published paper. It's missing the Multiscale L1 loss in phase 2 (currently it only does the L1 calculation at full scale, together with the MS-SSIM loss). Added TV Loss to phase 1 (Content Reconstruction), HFEN to phase 2 (Structure Reconstruction) and left phase 3 (Perceptual Reconstruction) with the same GAN and VGG_Feature loss as the original and can use an alternative learning rate scheme (MultiStepLR_Restart) or the original StepLR_Restart from the paper (all these options are configurable in the JSON file). Training doesn't necessarily have to stop after finishing phase 3, but it should to be the same as in the paper.
- [x] Replace JSON training options with YAML for more readability and proper comment syntax.


An image super-resolution toolkit flexible for development. It now provides:

1. **PSNR-oriented SR** models (e.g., SRCNN, SRResNet and etc). You can try different architectures, e.g, ResNet Block, ResNeXt Block, Dense Block, Residual Dense Block, Poly Block, Dual Path Block, Squeeze-and-Excitation Block, Residual-in-Residual Dense Block and etc.
<!--   1. want to compare more structures for SR. e.g. ResNet Block, ResNeXt Block, Dense Block, Residual Dense Block, Poly Block, Dual Path Block, Squeeze-and-Excitation Block and etc.
   1. want to provide some useful tricks for training SR networks.
   1. We are also curious to know what is the upper bound of PSNR for bicubic downsampling kernel by using an extremely large model.-->
2. [**Enhanced SRGAN**](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN) model (It can also train the **SRGAN** model). Enhanced SRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than [SRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) and won the first place in the [PIRM2018-SR Challenge](https://www.pirm2018.org/PIRM-SR.html). For more details, please refer to [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219), [ESRGAN repo](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN). (If you just want to test the model, [ESRGAN repo](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN) provides simpler testing codes.)

</p>

3. [**SFTGAN**](https://github.com/xinntao/CVPR18-SFTGAN) model. It adopts Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) to effectively incorporate other conditions/priors, like semantic prior for image SR, representing by segmentation probability maps. For more details, please refer to [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02815), [SFTGAN repo](https://github.com/xinntao/CVPR18-SFTGAN).

</p>

4. [**PPON**](https://github.com/Zheng222/PPON) model. The model for "Progressive Perception-Oriented Network for Single Image Super-Resolution", which the authors compare favorably against ESRGAN. Training is done progressively, by freezing and unfreezing layers in phases, which are: Content Reconstruction, Structure Reconstruction and Perceptual Reconstruction. For more details, please refer to [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10399), [PPON repo](https://github.com/Zheng222/PPON). The pretrained model for download can also be found in the original repo.

1. Run command: `python test_ppon.py -opt options/test/test_ppon.json`

## How to Train
### Train ESRGAN (SRGAN) models
We use a PSNR-oriented pretrained SR model to initialize the parameters for better quality. According to the author's paper and some testing, this will also stabilize the GAN training and allows for faster convergence. 

1. Prepare datasets, usually the DIV2K dataset. More details are in [`codes/data`](https://github.com/victorca25/BasicSR/tree/master/codes/data) and [
(Faster IO speed)](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/wiki/Faster-IO-speed). 
1. Optional: If the intention is to replicate the original paper here you would prepare the PSNR-oriented pretrained model. You can also use the original `RRDB_PSNR_x4.pth` as the pretrained model for that purpose, otherwise *any* existing model will work as pretrained.
1. Modify the configuration file  `options/train/train_esrgan.yaml`
1. Run command: `python train.py -o options/train/train_esrgan.yaml`

### Train SR models
1. Prepare datasets, usually the DIV2K dataset. More details are in [`codes/data`](https://github.com/victorca25/BasicSR/tree/master/codes/data). 
1. Modify the configuration file `options/train/train_sr.yaml`
1. Run command: `python train.py -o options/train/train_sr.yaml`

### Train SFTGAN models
*Pretraining is also important*. We use a PSNR-oriented pretrained SR model (trained on DIV2K) to initialize the SFTGAN model.

1. First prepare the segmentation probability maps for training data: run [`test_seg.py`](https://github.com/victorca25/BasicSR/blob/master/codes/test_seg.py). We provide a pretrained segmentation model for 7 outdoor categories in [Pretrained models](#pretrained-models). We use [Xiaoxiao Li's codes](https://github.com/lxx1991/caffe_mpi) to train our segmentation model and transfer it to a PyTorch model.
1. Put the images and segmentation probability maps in a folder as described in [`codes/data`](https://github.com/victorca25/BasicSR/tree/master/codes/data).
1. Transfer the pretrained model parameters to the SFTGAN model. 
    1. First train with `debug` mode and obtain a saved model.
    1. Run [`transfer_params_sft.py`](https://github.com/victorca25/BasicSR/blob/master/codes/scripts/transfer_params_sft.py) to initialize the model.
    1. We provide an initialized model named `sft_net_ini.pth` in [Pretrained models](#pretrained-models)
1. Modify the configuration file in `options/train/train_sftgan.yaml`
1. Run command: `python train.py -o options/train/train_sftgan.yaml`

### Train PPON models
1. Prepare datasets, usually the DIV2K dataset. More details are in [`codes/data`](https://github.com/victorca25/BasicSR/tree/master/codes/data). 
1. Modify the configuration file `options/train/train_PPON.yaml`
1. Run command: `python train_ppon.py -o options/train/train_PPON.yaml`

### Resuming Training
Simply pass the training_state folder path from the experiment folder to `resume_state` in your training yaml file.  
If you want to resume from an earlier state than the last checkpoint, pass the specific state file from that folder.

Any dataset can be augmented to expose the model to information that might not be available in the images, such a noise and blur. For this reason, [Data Augmentation](https://github.com/victorca25/BasicSR/wiki/Dataset-Augmentation) has been added to the options in this repository and it can be extended to include other types of augmentations.


# Pretrained models
The most recent community pretrained models can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/alsa64/AI-wiki/wiki/Model-Database).

You can put the downloaded models in the default `experiments/pretrained_models` folder.

Models that were trained using the same pretrained model or are derivates of the same pretrained model are able to be interpolated to combine the properties of both. The original author demostrated this by interpolating the PSNR pretrained model (which is not perceptually good, but results in smooth images) with the ESRGAN resulting models that have more details but sometimes is excessive to control a balance in the resulting images, instead of interpolating the resulting images from both models, giving much better results.

The authors continued exploring the capabilities of linearly interpolating models in their new work "DNI" (CVPR19): [Deep Network Interpolation for Continuous Imagery Effect Transition](https://xinntao.github.io/projects/DNI) with very interesting results and examples. The script for interpolation can be found in the [net_interp.py](https://github.com/victorca25/BasicSR/blob/master/codes/scripts/net_interp.py) file, but a new version with more options will be commited at a later time. This is an alternative to create new models without additional training and also to create pretrained models for easier fine tuning.
